# Code of Conduct

The OCP on Nutanix labs have been specifically created for this workshop. You have been assigned a shared cluster. These Clusters are hosted on the HPOC environment and imaged accordingly to specific AOS, PC, AHV versions according to the labs. Therefore, we asked you to abide by the following rules:

### What NOT to do!

- Don’t upgrade AOS or any Cluster versions
- Don’t change default passwords
- Don't use other person's resource. Only use the resources assign to you.

### Tips for the doing the labs

- Don’t just COPY & PASTE commands without understanding the reason behind it
- If instructions say type “XYZ”, it doesn’t mean to type ~~“XYZ”~~
- If in doubt, ^^ASK!^^
