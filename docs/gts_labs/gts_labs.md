# Code of Conduct

The OCP on Nutanix labs have been specifically created for this workshop. You have been assigned a shared cluster. These Clusters are hosted on the HPOC environment and imaged accordingly to specific AOS, PC, AHV versions according to the labs. 

We also did some additional configuration by automation. Check the code [here](https://github.com/nutanix-japan/tf-gso)

We ask you the following:

### What NOT to do!

- Do not upgrade AOS or any Cluster versions
- Do not change default passwords
- Do not use other person's resource. Only use the resources assigned to you.

### Tips for the doing the labs

- Read the lab section from top to bottom, create a mental picture of activities and then attempt the labs
- Troubleshoot - do not expect labs to just work
- Do not just COPY & PASTE commands without understanding the reason behind it
- If instructions say type “XYZ”, it doesn’t mean to type ~~“XYZ”~~
- If in doubt, ^^ASK FOR HELP!^^
