# Code of Conduct

The labs have been specifically created for this offsite event. For each lab, you may be assigned to your own cluster OR a shared cluster. These Clusters are hosted on the HPOC environment and imaged accordingly to specific AOS, PC, AHV versions according to the labs. Therefore, we asked you to abide by the following rules:

### What NOT to do!

- Don’t upgrade AOS or any Cluster versions
- Don’t change default passwords
- Don't use other person's resource. Only use the resources assign to you.

### Tips for the doing the labs

- Go through instruction first and understand why 
- Discuss with your peers and help each other
- Don’t just COPY & PASTE commands without understanding the reason behind it
- If instructions say type “XYZ”, it doesn’t mean to type “XYZ”
- Don’t rush through the labs.
- If in doubt, ask one of the proctors for help
