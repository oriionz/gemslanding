# Welcome

Welcome to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam!


In continuation of the SKO24 theme, **“all happens out there”**— we need to show up “everywhere” our customers and prospects are—and we need to act quickly to take full advantage of different unique market opportunity.


During this week, you will learn how to better drive Cloud conversations and learn more about the role Nutanix plays in a **Cloud-Native** ecosystem. This program has been developed for you and will serve as a on-going curriculum towards your badges. 

The 2nd part of the week will be primarily focus on account planning and we welcome the GEMS AE Team to take part in this exciting workshop. During this workshop AE’s and SE’s will work together in teams to create executable Account Plans which will help drive success in your territory and region in FY24

We look forward to seeing everyone in Vietnam!
